## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-Emmanuel/The-AIBert.git
cd The-AIBert
```

---

### 2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. **Create a `.env` file**

Create a `.env` in the **root directory** and add your sensitive credentials:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_API_KEY=your_google_api_key (if needed)
```

> ‚úÖ **Do NOT commit your `.env` file.** It's listed in `.gitignore` for safety.

---

### 4. **Run the project locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> This uses **Vite** to start the project on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).
